# K6 Performance Testing Framework

Hey there! I built this performance testing framework after spending way too much time setting up the same k6 tests over and over again. I figured there had to be a better way to handle load testing, so I created this comprehensive framework that covers pretty much everything you'd need.

## What This Framework Does

After working on multiple projects, I realized I was constantly recreating the same performance testing patterns. So I decided to build something reusable that would save me (and hopefully you) a ton of time. Here's what I included:

- **API Testing**: REST endpoints, GraphQL, authentication flows
- **UI Testing**: Page load times, user interactions, static assets
- **Multiple Test Types**: Smoke tests (quick checks), load tests (normal usage), stress tests (breaking points), spike tests (sudden traffic)
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Combined tests that mimic actual user behavior
- **Easy Configuration**: Everything's centralized so you can customize it without hunting through files

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install k6

First things first - you'll need k6 installed on your machine. Here's how to get it set up:

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install k6
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
choco install k6
```

**On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo gpg -k
sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install k6
```

**Make sure it worked:**
```bash
k6 version
```

You should see something like "k6 v0.47.0" or similar. If you get a "command not found" error, you might need to restart your terminal or check your PATH.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/String-Gaurav/K6-PerformanceTests.git
   cd K6-PerformanceTests
   ```

2. **Check the structure:**
   ```
   ├── config/
   │   └── base-config.js          # Main settings file
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── api/                    # API test files
   │   └── ui/                     # UI test files
   ├── scenarios/                  # Test scenarios (smoke, load, stress)
   ├── utils/                      # Helper functions
   ├── examples/                   # Example scripts
   └── demo.sh                     # Quick demo script
   ```

### Step 3: Configure for Your Application

The main configuration is in `config/base-config.js`. You'll need to update a few things:

1. **Change the base URL:**
   ```javascript
   export const BASE_CONFIG = {
     BASE_URL: 'https://your-api.com',  // Change this to your API
     API_BASE_URL: 'https://your-api.com/api',  // Your API endpoint
     // ... rest of the config
   };
   ```

2. **Adjust thresholds for your needs:**
   ```javascript
   THRESHOLDS: {
     http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],  // 95% of requests under 500ms
     http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],     // Less than 10% failures
     checks: ['rate>0.9']               // 90% of checks should pass
   }
   ```

3. **Update test data:**
   ```javascript
   TEST_DATA: {
     validUser: { email: 'test@yourdomain.com', password: 'yourpassword' },
     // ... other test data
   }
   ```

## Running Your First Tests

### Quick Demo

I included a demo script to get you started quickly:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

This runs a few different test types so you can see how everything works.

### Individual Test Types

**Smoke Test (Quick validation):**
```bash
k6 run scenarios/api-smoke-test.js
```

**Load Test (Normal usage simulation):**
```bash
k6 run scenarios/api-load-test.js
```

**Stress Test (Find breaking points):**
```bash
k6 run scenarios/api-stress-test.js
```

**UI Performance Test:**
```bash
k6 run scenarios/ui-load-test.js
```

## Understanding the Results

When you run a test, k6 shows you detailed metrics:

### Key Metrics to Watch

- **http_req_duration**: How long requests take
  - `avg`: Average response time
  - `p(95)`: 95% of requests are faster than this
  - `p(99)`: 99% of requests are faster than this

- **http_req_failed**: Percentage of failed requests
- **http_reqs**: Total number of requests made
- **checks**: How many of your assertions passed

### Example Good Results
```
✓ http_req_duration: p(95)=245ms (threshold: 500ms)    # Fast responses
✓ http_req_failed: 0.5% (threshold: 10%)               # Low error rate
✓ checks: 98.5% (threshold: 90%)                       # Most checks passed
```

### Example Concerning Results
```
✗ http_req_duration: p(95)=1200ms (threshold: 500ms)  # Slow responses
✓ http_req_failed: 2.5% (threshold: 10%)               # Acceptable errors
✗ checks: 85% (threshold: 90%)                         # Some checks failing
```

## Creating Your Own Tests

### Basic API Test

Here's a simple test you can create:

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,        // 10 virtual users
  duration: '30s' // Run for 30 seconds
};

export default function() {
  // Make a GET request
  const response = http.get('https://your-api.com/users');
  
  // Check if it worked
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
    'response has users': (r) => r.json().users.length > 0
  });
}
```

### POST Request Test

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  vus: 5,
  duration: '1m'
};

export default function() {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Test User',
    email: 'test@example.com'
  });

  const response = http.post('https://your-api.com/users', payload, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });

  check(response, {
    'user created successfully': (r) => r.status === 201,
    'response time < 1s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 1000
  });
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Connection Refused" Errors

This usually means your API isn't running or the URL is wrong.

**Check:**
1. Is your API server running?
2. Is the URL in `base-config.js` correct?
3. Can you access the URL in your browser?

### High Error Rates

If you're seeing lots of failed requests:

**Possible causes:**
1. **Rate limiting**: Your API might be blocking too many requests
2. **Authentication issues**: Check if your API requires authentication
3. **Server overload**: The server might not handle the load

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce the number of virtual users (`vus`)
2. Add delays between requests (`sleep(1)`)
3. Check your API logs for specific errors

### Slow Response Times

If requests are taking too long:

**Check:**
1. Is your API optimized?
2. Are you testing against the right environment?
3. Is your network connection stable?

**Solutions:**
1. Test against a staging environment first
2. Use smaller load initially
3. Check if your API has caching enabled

## Customizing for Your Needs

### Different Environments

I set up the framework to easily switch between environments:

```javascript
// In base-config.js
const environment = __ENV.ENV || 'staging';

const configs = {
  staging: {
    BASE_URL: 'https://staging.yourapp.com'
  },
  production: {
    BASE_URL: 'https://yourapp.com'
  }
};

export const BASE_CONFIG = configs[environment];
```

Then run tests like:
```bash
ENV=staging k6 run scenarios/api-load-test.js
ENV=production k6 run scenarios/api-smoke-test.js
```

### Custom Test Scenarios

You can create your own scenarios by combining different test functions:

```javascript
import { testGetUsers, testCreateUser } from '../tests/api/user-tests.js';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    read_heavy: {
      executor: 'constant-vus',
      vus: 20,
      duration: '2m',
      exec: 'readScenario'
    },
    write_heavy: {
      executor: 'constant-vus',
      vus: 5,
      duration: '2m',
      exec: 'writeScenario'
    }
  }
};

export function readScenario() {
  testGetUsers();
  testGetUserProfile();
}

export function writeScenario() {
  testCreateUser();
  testUpdateUser();
}
```

## Best Practices I've Learned

### Start Small
Don't jump straight to 1000 virtual users. Start with:
1. Smoke test (1 user, 30 seconds)
2. Light load (5 users, 2 minutes)
3. Medium load (20 users, 5 minutes)
4. Heavy load (50+ users, 10+ minutes)

### Test Regularly
- Run smoke tests after every deployment
- Run load tests weekly
- Run stress tests before major releases

### Monitor Key Metrics
Focus on these metrics:
- **Response time percentiles** (p95, p99)
- **Error rates** (should be under 5%)
- **Throughput** (requests per second)

### Use Realistic Data
Make sure your test data looks like real user data.
